It is still not known whether the ship came down from the moon in [c][8ab3ff]The Downfall[-][/c] or if it was buried in the ice all this time.\n\nThe spacecraft was taken to the nearest and best-equipped facility in [c][8ab3ff]New Zealand[-][/c] that was able to properly perform the examination and replication of the alien technology where it underwent extensive testing and experimentation at the hands of the world's best specialists.\nProgress was slow, as many of the materials the spacecraft (named ""[c][8ab3ff]Phoenix-1[-][/c]"") was made from could not be found or replicated and the computer systems that operated the ship were heavily degraded. Even still, the technological advancements in a multitude of scientific fields was significant and by 2461 the first UCH-built spacecraft capable of extrasolar warp was built: The [c][8ab3ff]UCH-001 Hyperion[-][/c].\n\nAfter dozens of successful warp tests over the course of four years, the Hyperion was determined to be a success and full-scale production of a Fleet was ordered. [c][8ab3ff]Operation Phoenix[-][/c] was confirmed.\n[b]There were two goals to this UCH Fleet:[/b]\nThe first was to find more of the materials retrieved from the Phoenix-1 and establish a supply line back to Earth. Using the technological advances of the alien technology to reverse the damage dealt to the planet from The Downfall using new materials in terraforming applications.\nThe second, if the first failed, was to find and colonize a habitable planet and begin the transfer of the human population to the new planet.\n\nIt wasn't surprising that the alien spacecraft recovered from Antarctica was equipped with weapons, they were theorized to be used for destroying meteorites and preventing collisions. Until the final flight of the Hyperion in [c][8ab3ff]2472[-][/c], where a long-ranged warp jump past Jupiter where the fleet was being assembled at [c][8ab3ff]Apollon Station[-][/c] ended with the disappearance of the Hyperion.\nThere were no problems with the Hyperion's warp drive and no observable issues with its insertion into [c][8ab3ff]Hyperspace[-][/c]. Suddenly the prospect of jumping a fleet of unarmed transports to [c][8ab3ff]Proxima Centauri[-][/c], the nearest habitable system to our own, took on a darker tone and calls for weapons to be added to the fleet were made, as a precaution.\n\nOn [c][8ab3ff]25 July 2473[-][/c] the UCH Fleet departed the fleet construction yards at Apollon Station in Jupiter's outer orbit and prepared a warp jump utilizing the [c][8ab3ff]UCH-002 M.S Titan[-][/c]'s Warp Field Generator to create a warp field large enough to move the entire fleet to Proxima Centauri.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_CKKWES4,"[b][c][ffffff]Shields:[-][/c][/b]\nShields are defensive countermeasures employed by a variety of vessels and structures designed to deflect or absorb the impacts of conventional kinetic weaponry and explosives; reducing their damage to a structure by consuming power and a catalyst (Pentaxid).\nWhile shields will protect from any weapon, they are highly resilient to [c][ffffff]kinetic weapons[-][/c] such as [c][ff5c5c]Miniguns, Cannons, Flak Shells, Rockets, Missiles, Railgun Slugs[-][/c] and [c][ff5c5c]Artillery Shells[-][/c].\nConversely, shields are highly susceptible to damage from [c][ffffff]Energy-based weapons[-][/c] such as [c][6bd600]Lasers, Plasma, Positron Beams, Electromagnetic Pulse Weapons, Antimatter Torpedoes[-][/c] and[c][6bd600] Ion Cannons[-][/c] that will quickly deplete shields under sustained fire.\n\nThe majority of Zirax weaponry consists of energy weapons. However, in order to operate in any atmosphere, their weapons possess lower accuracy, speed and lose a great deal of energy in thermal output. This makes their lasers easier to dodge for faster crafts and deal less shield damage than the weapons of Polaris, Kriel or the UCH but more versatile.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Shield Boosters:[-][/c][/b]\nA recent advancement in shielding technology has lead to the development of shield modulation technology. In the past, shields were a fixed thing. You would use a shield and it would provide total protection.\nWith the advent of the Shield Booster technology, it's possible to improve the strength or charging speed of your shields. They do come at a cost however as the devices draw power while the shield is charging and are quite heavy.\n[b][c][00ff00]Shield Capacitor:[-][/c][/b] Increases the strength of your shields, but reduces the speed at which they recharge slightly.\n[b][c][ffbb00]Shield Charger:[-][/c][/b] Increases the recharge speed of your shields, but reduces their strength slightly.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Contact Surfaces:[-][/c][/b]\nA ship is comprised of many moving parts, and many of those parts are in contact with high energy ejections, such as weapons and thrusters. These provide a constant drain on the energy a shield generator needs to use to operate.\nIn order to prevent the shields from draining from the plasma of thrusters or the force being imparted on the barrels of weapons, energy buffers are included in such devices that consume power from the shield generators without impacting their performance.\n[b][c][dd0000]Thrusters (CV):[-][/c][/b] Reduce shield capacity by 5 for each thruster\n[b][c][dd0000]Weapons (CV/BA):[-][/c][/b] Reduce shield capacity by 25 for each conventional weapon and 50 for each energy weapon\n[b][c][dd0000]Weapons (HV/SV):[-][/c][/b] Reduce shield capacity by 10 for each conventional weapon and 15 for each energy weapon\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Obtaining Advanced Shields:[-][/c][/b]\nShield Generators are upgraded from the lower grade to the higher grades using a Multitool set to the Upgrade Mode. Shield Generators can similarly be downgraded using the Downgrade function.\nYou must have the correct Shield Generator unlocked in your Tech Tree and the materials to upgrade in your inventory or in a connected container.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_aCCiai8,"[b][c][00ffee][u]CPU Restrictions:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nEvery structure has a pre-set limit of CPU that the Core uses to run your ship's systems. If you exceed the maximum CPU limit, you will begin to take penalties to your efficiency that will negatively affect your ship's performance in several aspects.\nThrusters will produce less thrust, Generators will output less power, Weapons will take longer to reload, Turrets will turn slower and Constructors will function at reduced speed.\nThis is particularly dangerous in combat as reduced power output will cause your generators to overheat and begin to take damage and eventually explode while accelerating.\nBuilding blocks do NOT consume CPU.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]CPU Extenders:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nAs you run low on CPU, you can suppliment your Core's default CPU amount with Extenders that will consume power to output additional CPU and increase your CPU limit roughly equal to the core itself.\nThe amount of CPU given from each Extender is shown on the extender block itself, so the more extenders you have, the more CPU you will get in much the same as generator or oxygen or fuel tank usage. [c][ff0000]There are [i]no[/i] CPU Tiers[-][/c].\nUnlike with the default game, if you lose a CPU Extender, your ship is not instantly crippled, followed by all the generators exploding. You lose only the CPU that extender represented; reducing your efficiency if you were close to the limit, but nothing more.\n\n[b][c][00ffee][u]Building for Efficiency:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nBigger is better. Larger thrusters are more CPU, Power, Mass and Space-efficient over multiple smaller thrusters; The same rules apply to generators, oxygen and fuel tanks.\nFocus your ship's function into a single role. It's better to do one or two things really well, than trying to win a fight carrying everything you own slowing you down and making every fight a nightmare as even the smallest amount of hull damage may lose valuable cargo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike similar large spiders of earth, the arrangement of eyes, chelicerae and lack of hair makes actual classification difficult due to it's ability to consume and digest food internally, which is completely different from any known earth spider.\n\nPossessing brown or tan camouflage coloration on the legs, abdomen and thorax; and hinged chelcerae with secondary jaws, the Erebus Spider survives as an ambush predator. Hiding amongst trees, bushes and tall grass until potential pret approaches before launching in a headlong sprint at its target.\nMidly-venomous, the Erebus Spider relies on its chelicerae to pincer the limbs of its prey and break bones with its impressive biteforce, thus preventing escape and allowing the spider to take its time dismembering its prey.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: The Erebus Spider is an invasive species of arachnid commonly found on many planets in the local system. The presence of these spiders on so many planets indicates that they were intentionally or accidentally introduced from another planet.\nWhile destructive to native flora and fauna, they survive mostly on a diet of Leafcutter Insects, but are not averse to attacking anything that strays close to their nests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite it's massive size, its exoskeleton is mostly hollow in order to regulate temperature in direct sunlight.\nUnlike the Erebus Spider, the Charon Spider has quite strong venom and does not possess the ability to seize and hold prey. Instead choosing to strike fast and retreat while its poison takes effect and begins to slow the target enough for it to go in for the kill with little risk for itself.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: The Charon Spider is fairly solitary and do not roam far from their nest; usually under large rocks and in canyons in arid regions near streams or springs where prey are most common.\nAlthough found on many planets, they are not destructive to the environment and are known to keep many of the more dangerous predator's numbers in check.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much like the namesake, the Pluton Spider is found underground in caves and abandoned buildings where it's cool, damp and dark.\nPluton Spider are known to take down predator and prey several times their size due to their ability to spit venom to stun and incapacitate the target without ever getting into reach.\nSpecially developed eyes and exoskeleton allow it to see infrared and adjust the patterning across its back to improve concealment. While it does possess minor camouflaging abilities that let it adjust the patterns on it's body, it cannot change the coloration.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Pluton Spiders rarely stray into daylight and so an accurate count of their locations and population density is unknown. They are found in many planets and have a preference for the damp, dark confines of abandoned buildings and the biomechanically-grown arterial tunnels left in the wake of a Legacy infestation over the caves they evolved to survive in. It's believed that this preference is due to the radioactive nature of any Promethium-powered reactor and the self-sustaining energy systems inherent in Legacy technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a leaf-green exoskeleton with a marbled brown to red carapace running from the optical turret at the top of its head to its tail.\nDespite the name, the Leafcutter Insect is more closely related to Crustaceans rather than other hexapods. Omnivorous, it bears compact internal organs beneath its hard carapace and a protruding optical turret that gives it a 270 degree field of view of its surroundings.\n\nDespite lacking the ability to bite any interloper in their territory due to their unusually arranged mouth, their specially-evolved forelegs possess an extremely powerful kick capable of denting steel. Coupled with sharped, edged barbs on the backs of the forelegs typically used for cutting plant stems and dragging food into their mouth, they allow the Leafcutter Insect to pierce and hang onto their would-be predator.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Leafcutter Insects are commonly found all across the Andromeda Galaxy, usually in temperate grassy plains and forests where much of their food is found.

Despite it's fearsome appearance, the Thymosaurus is largely passive; Eating mostly carrion and some large insects. It prefers to roam solitarily across temperate planet's equatorial band in search of potential mates.\n\nThe Thymosaurus' intimidating appearance belies it's fragile physiology as it suffers from poor eyesight due to the size and position of its eyes on its broad head coupled with inadequate reach and strength in its forelimbs. These weaknesses are made up for with the incredible strength of its hind limbs and tail, on the end of which it possesses a heavily armored thagomizer which it can swing with a force upwards of 1000 Newtons.\n\nWhile not naturally aggressive, the Thymosaurus has an exceedingly thick hide and bones, making it very durable to both impacts and penetration; necessary when fighting off rivals for a mate that are similarly equipped with a spiked, hammer-like tail for which it's named.\nAs such, it's best to avoid angering one if at all possible as they are known to pursue an aggressor back to their home and exact retribution.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Thymosaurus are typically found on temperate planets, between grassy meadows and the savannah where their chosen food source (Erebus Spiders and Leafcutter Insects) are most abundant.\nAlthough they are known to eat Telluropods, they will generally avoid large bodies of water due to their propensity for overbalancing. Drinking from a lake or pond for a Thymosaurus is typically done from a prone position, which leaves it open for attack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Used to deposit eggs into the wound made by the stinger, and poison in order to slowly kill the target; ensuring a rich environment in which the new hatchlings can grow.\n\nOriginating from a barren, red, volcanic environment the Nyxiss Scorpion evolved to blend in with the reds and browns of it's home world. It has extreme resistance to high temperatures and can survive in temperatures exceeding 700 degrees celcius. This resistance to heat has aided them in becoming widespread across the galaxy by climbing into the vents and thruster exhausts of landed cargo ships and escaping to more temperate planets; provided they can survive in vacuum long enough.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Nyxiss Scorpions can be found on a wide variety of planets; usually in warm, dark or radioactive environments underground. They are very rarely seen on the surface and prefer to hide in vents in abandoned structures or the organic arterial tunnels left in the wake of a Legacy infestation.\nOn their home planets, volcanic activity and high temperatures force them to remain on the surface and avoid underground burrows making their appearance on magmatic worlds far more common; and their appearance much harder to discern among the red rocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a chitinous exoskeleton that protects its internal organs and powerful legs, the Wraithworm Queen outclasses any other known insect in both size and mass.\nBy expanding the chitin plates on it's abdomen it is able to inflate it's stomach and align it's esophagus linearly and by contracting the muscles rapidly can expel toxic and corrosive gastric juices as a projectile up to 30 meters as a defensive mechanism.\n\nMale Wraithworms are far smaller than their female counterparts, being mostly blind and short limbed; they spend almost all of their lives burrowed deep underground. Males attract female Wraithworms by creating a spacious burrow for the queen, with walls hardened with saliva excreted to support larger rooms.\nFemales will choose males that provide the largest burrow, determining that they possess the strength, skills and hardening to produce better offspring.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Although not as numerous as the male counterpart; the Wraithworm Queen is the most commonly encountered due to its size. They do not burrow as the male does, so spend most of their unmated time above ground until approached by a prospective mate.\nThis is problematic on inhabited planets, as males will often burrow into artificial structures and claim them as a nest to attract females.

Having developed a means of eating while underground, it is incapable of eating it's food while above ground. Seemingly oblivious to anything on the surface unless defending itself.\nLike female wraithworms the Sandsiphon can spit a ball of digestive fluids at an attacker or when startled that is both toxic and corrosive to most metals.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Sandsiphons are quite common on arid and desertous planets. However, due to their nature of burrowing through the sand, they are rarely seen on the surface.

It seems to share a common evolutionary path to those of the Dromaeosaurid Genus of the Cretaceous period, but with a tendency towards a more reptillian form over the feathered contemporaries of our own galaxy.\nThis development is thought to be due to their environment being primarily tropical where the development of feathers would hinder the creature while stalking prey in the wet jungle and cause numerous health problems.\n\nAndroraptors travel and hunt in family packs, with the younger raptors being educated during the daytime by following behind the parents and imitating their actions to take down prey with supervision. During the night however, the parents hunt freely making night time especially hazardous for prey and human alike as these fully-grown raptors are larger, faster and more vicious at night while unrestrained with taking care of youngsters.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Androraptors are widespread across the Andromeda galaxy and common on most breathable Temperate planets.

It is distantly related to the Androraptor, but appears to be further up the evolutionary chain and more closely related to the bird-like development as seen in earth's dinosaurs.\nOviraptors move in mated pairs, ranging great distances without claimed territory while raising their offspring. Only building nests to house their eggs and early stages of development of their children until they're old enough to begin moving on their own.\n\nOviraptors are omnivorous, eating berries, fruit, mushrooms and nuts when available; hunting vertebrates such as Erebus spiders and Leafcutters when easy prey is encountered. But otherwise are completely passive to anything that does not immediately pose a threat to them or their young. Preferring to flee, rather than attack when approached unless something harms their offspring.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Oviraptors prefer cold climates and are often found in or near snow in family groups of two adults and as many as five young. They are not harmful to the environment and do not engage in territorial disputes with other life forms.\nAlthough parents will attack anything that harms their offspring; the children themselves are curious and playful and will often follow and get into mischief in human camps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where the mouth was equipped with several sets of heavy molar-like teeth on the creature's palate, assumed to be used for eating plants. Live examples identified that the teeth were used to grind bones and rock salt from dry seabeds.\n\nIgnidon live solitary lives in open dunes, assuming the appearance of rock formations during the day to keep heat down and to lure prey to approach them in search of insects found beneath desert rocks. Roaming the desert at night when it's cooler and relocating to a new resting place by dawn.\n\nUnusually, the Ignidon's upper esophagus is equipped with valve that allows it to vomit an organic oily compound produced in a humped cavity between the creature's shoulders that will ignite when exposed to oxygen. This compound is usually used in mating displays, but can also be propelled with significant range and dispersal to become a jet of flame; amending the name ""Agni"" (Fire) to the taxonomic name of the creature.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Ignidon are commonly found in arid and desert environments; They appear most commonly in sandy dunes and at the edge of water sources and most prominently at night.\nThey are not particularly fast on their feet and have limited eyesight, making them only a minor nuisance to locals traversing the desert in hover vessels at night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other developments to the body allude to evolution in a largely aquatic environment due to webbing on the feet and fins on the tail which suggest that the development of the mouth was in order to hunt some form of shelled creature like a turtle. Though cannot be confirmed at this time.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Ripperdogs are found only within the care of Zirax personnel and never encountered in the wild. This indicates that their numbers are kept under strict control by the zirax, or that they are unable to breed in certain conditions, if not neutered before being brought offworld.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rising slowly and carefully in the vicinity of prey, typically covered in vines and rotting vegetation to obscure its smell and appearance.\n\nLike other members of the Gigas family, the Swamp Gigas has a tendency to collect shiny objects that it finds while traversing it's home environment; often using them in an elaborate mating ritual by presenting their most impressive finds to a prospective mate in an unusually human act.\nSuch acts are generally performed after a suitable nest or den has been found or constructed; usually inside large hollow tree trunks above the water line.\n\nAs expected of a creature of this size, the Gigas has significant strength and speed coupled with bone-reinforced knuckles it can deal extreme blunt force trauma with even a glancing blow.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Swamp Gigas are found exclusively in humid environments, rich in vegetation and water; preferring the murky waterways than the shore, jungle or beaches.

Branching off from the main Andromedan genus several hundred thousand years ago, likely due to adverse environmental factors. The result of this evolutionary change includes developed legs designed for prolonged travel at speed and a vertically-aligned mouth developed for eating the bark of the larger and hardier trees; rather than leaves or grass. This trait is also shared by the Leafcutter insect, suggesting a common factor.\n\nMoularidons form family packs or herds of females and offspring much like Elephants. Males, or bulls roam either alone or with other males until breeding season. Although there is often threat displays and sparring among the males when contesting a mate, there are rarely any serious fights that cause injury.\n\nBecause of their intelligence, size, strength and stamina, the Tal'ohn utilize Moularidons for transport and heavy lifting. Taking a great deal of care of their Moularidon population and protecting wild herds from Zirax poachers, even at risk to themselves.\nMoularidon are also farmed for milk by the Tal'ohn as one of their main exports, commanding a high price on the commodities market. Attempts by outside groups to farm Moularidon for milk on a commercial scale have failed repeatedly, keeping this product firmly in Tal'ohn hands for the forseeable future.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Moularidon are found exclusively on Temperate planets, rich in trees and wildlife. They will typically spend their days in open meadows near a water source and venture into the forest to feed on the bark of the older trees.\nThey avoid the rainforest and jungles at night due to the increased Androraptor presence as this is the time when the Adults hunt, and are known to target Moularidons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Be prepared and get your turrets up quick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_CW0OCiG,"[b][c][00ffee][u]Base Attacks:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nYou've placed your first Base, which means you're ready to establish advanced production methods required for improved thrusters, weapons and ammunition for higher quality ships. However, the Zirax are aware that you have built a base and likely on a planet in their domain.\nThey will be sending troop transports, Drones and Bombers to take out your base, so the first thing you need to get in place to protect your investments are [b][c][ff5c5c]TURRETS[-][/c][/b]. Without Turrets, you have no hope of defending your base from even the most minor of attacks.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Point Defense:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nThe first thing you'll need on your base is a Generator, Fuel Tank, Ammunition Container or Controller, a Small Constructor (for Base) or better. With your constructor powered and supplied, you can now produce your first turrets with basic materials (Iron, Copper, Silicon) that will keep your base defended.\n\n[b][c][ffae00]Projectile Turrets (Base)[-][/c][/b]\n[b][c][ffffff]Minigun Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Minigun Turret is the best weapon for base defense. While it has slightly shorter range than the Cannon Turret, it has a higher rotation speed, better tracking and a higher damage modifier against drones and troop transports. It suffers a damage penalty against blocks though, making it less effective when used offensively against ships and POIs.\n[b][c][ffffff]Cannon Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Cannon Turret is best used against ships and blocks. It's more accurate than the minigun turret, but turns slower while tracking a fast object (E.g. Bombers). It suffers from a minor damage penalty against drones and other entities, while receiving a damage bonus against armor blocks.\n\nBy taking manual control of either turret, you gain extra combat effectiveness.\n[b][c][ffffff]Minigun Turret:[-][/c][/b] By holding LMB + RMB you can remove the safety limiter on the turret and fire it manually far faster than the turret can fire on it's own. You will lose accuracy at long range though.\n[b][c][ffffff]Cannon Turret:[-][/c][/b] The Cannon turret will also fire slightly faster while operated manually. RMB lets you change the ammunition settings to fire incendiary rounds that explode when they hit an enemy.\n\n[b][u][c][ff0000]Enemy Units:[-][/c][/u][/b]\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Minigun Siege Drones:[-][/c][/b] These relatively slow-moving drones are well armored and equipped with specialized ammunition designed to impart thermal damage to shields; causing more damage than regular UCH ammunition to shields.\nUltimately, these drones are designed for focused attacks and search and destroy missions.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Rocket Siege Drones:[-][/c][/b] High-speed drones equipped with a pair of rocket racks. They circle your base before launching a bombardment of low-impact rockets over a wide area. In order to function at this speed, they are only lightly armored and can be destroyed by a Minigun Turret or two easily.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Light Bomber:[-][/c][/b] The most dangerous unit deployed in early base attacks is the Light Bomber. More durable than the Rocket Siege Drones and with considerably better accuracy; the Light Bomber drops a single high-explosive bomb at key targets on your base.\n\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Troop Transport: [-][/c][/b]The light troop transport is durable, but slow aircraft. It can carry up to 8 troops and is unarmed, but will usually not exceed a squad of 6. Your typical full base attack will consist of at least one Troop transport supported by siege drones acting as both protection and decoys while the transport lands.\n\n[b][u][c][ff0000]Invasion Force:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nInvasion level base attacks only occur on higher difficulty planet and ONLY if your base is placed within zirax-claimed territory. You will have a high chance of getting a different set of enemies that are going to [i]really[/i] want to take your base.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Siege Drone (Minigun)[-][/c][/b]: Twice the firepower, Twice the size, Triple the health.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Siege Drone (Rocket)[-][/c][/b]: Same firepower, twice the size, twice the health.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Heavy Bomber[-][/c][/b]: A more durable, angrier version of the Light Bomber.\n[b][c][ff5c5c]Troop Dropship[-][/c][/b]: Better armored, these dropships can carry up to 16 troops.\nA high-end invasion force will not be a couple of drones and a transport; you'll be facing a dozen drones and multiple dropships hell-bent on taking your base or turning it into a smoldering crater.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Tal'ohn Base Attacks:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nIf you're unlucky enough to anger the Tal'ohn, they too will attack your base. Not with drones or transports, but with overwhelming numbers of hunters and animals. It may seem comical, but many people have lost their bases against the Tal'ohn because they failed to eliminate the Shaman.\n\nIn the event of a Tal'ohn Base Attack, your goal should be the immediate removal of the Tal'ohn Shaman. You can see their location from the glowing pillar of light they produce. As long as one Shaman remains, more enemies will continue to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An abomination is the resulting Third Stage of genetic reconditioning by the virus as it has broken down the host's body down to the most vital elements and over time will slowly reconstruct the host by incorporating materials both organic and synthetic to create a new lifeform with the Fourth Stage.\nDue to a lack of stimulus and direction from the Gestalt that makes up the Legacy, Abomination very rarely evolve into a fourth-stage entity; eventually falling into stasis at a stalled state of development.\n\nAbomination are physically strong and moderately fast, possessing adaptive thermo-regulation that allows them to survive in the most hostile of environments, including the vaccuum of space.

While their higher cognitive and fabrication abilities appear to have been lost in the resolution of that long-ago war, they are still a force to be reckoned with.

pda_88aW040,"[c][00ffee][u][b]Heavy Weapons:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nHeavy Weapons are unlocked through the Tech Tree (F3) via the System Upgrades tab and are constructed using a Multitool set to UPGRADE on the mounted weapon or turret to upgrade it into a Heavy Turret.\nThese new turrets and weapons allow you to increase a ship's firepower without taking up additional space on your hull, so you don't need to increase the size of your vessel to mount extra weapons.\n\nHeavy Turrets rotate and track faster than their Standard equivalents, will often fire faster and for higher damage or possess unique functions that set them apart from standard weaponry. In most cases, Heavy weapons are twice as powerful as their standard versions, more durable and heavier, but are twice as costly to run.\n\n[c][00ffee][u][b]System Upgrade Kits:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nSystem Kits are used to upgrade or construct Heavy Weapons and other Upgraded systems and can be found in Alien Loot Containers (Rare Containers or better quality) or in the case of Advanced and Small Upgrade Kits can be bought from Traders (QuantumSTAR and InterWeapon Heavy, respectively).\nSystem Kits can also be salvaged from enemy Heavy Turrets.\n\n[u][c][00ffee][b]Heavy and Advanced Equipment:[/b][-][/c][/u]\n[b][u][c][00ffee][-][/c][/u][/b]\n[b][c][2eafff]Long-Range Radar:[-][/c][/b] A high-powered detector that will identify thermal and energy signatures at extremely long distances for a very short duration using LMB.\nUsing RMB will fire a secondary pulse that functions at the same distance as the standard detector but keep all identified targets displayed for twice as long.\n\n[b][c][2eafff]Heavy Laser Turrets:[-][/c][/b] An enhanced version of the standard laser turret. Heavy Laser Turrets can track targets faster than their standard versions and projectiles travel at the speed of light, making them virtually impossible to dodge.\nThe Zirax also possess Imperial Heavy Laser Turrets that function much the same. These are standard equipment for the Tovera-Class Dreadnought.\n\n[b][c][2eafff]Heavy Gatling Cannon:[-][/c][/b] An upgraded version of the Gatling Cannon that fires 20mm armor-piercing rounds. More accurate than the 15mm version and can be fired with LMB + RMB for even higher speeds.\n\n[b][c][2eafff]Heavy Laser Cannon (HV/SV):[-][/c][/b] An upgraded version of the Pulse Laser; These weapons were reverse-engineered from Zirax Interceptor weapons technology and are devastating against heavy shields.\n[b][c][2eafff][-][/c][/b]\n[b][c][2eafff]Torpedo Launcher:[-][/c][/b] The most devastating weapon available to a Small Vessel, the Torpedo Launcher is the upgraded version of the Bomb Launcher. Loaded with Sledgehammer Torpedoes these miniaturized nuclear weapons can rip massive holes through the unshielded hull of capital vessels. An impact against an SV however, will leave nothing but scraps of molten metal floating in space.\n[c][ff5c5c]Due to their weight and arming procedures, only two Torpedo Launchers can be used on a ship and will only function in space.[-][/c]\n\n[b][c][2eafff]Heavy Plasma Turrets:[-][/c][/b] For CV the Heavy Plasma is only slightly stronger than it's standard version. However, it fires 50% faster with higher projectile speeds with additional damage bonus modifiers vs Xenosteel and Legacy technology, making it the best weapon against Legacy Ship-Type Entities.\nFor the HV and SV version, instead of firing faster it fires slower but for significantly higher damage; putting it on par with the standard version of the CV Plasma Turret.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_SmgWSee,"[u][c][ff0000][b]Zirax Weaponry:[/b][-][/c][/u]\nYou've obtained an Imperial Zirax Turret. These weapons are heavily restricted and unauthorized use on a capital vessel is illegal by order of the Zirax High Command.\nThat being said, these unique turrets cannot be reproduced, reverse-engineered or replaced. Functionally, they are roughly equal to the standardized weapons used by the UCH and Polaris but require specialized ammunition in order to be fired. However, since Zirax weapons have been adapted for use in any environment, these Imperial Turrets are functional inside a planet's atmosphere, where the UCH turrets are NOT.\n\n[u][c][ff5c5c][b]Ammunition:[/b][-][/c][/u]\nZirax Ammunition is rare and expensive; for resupplying purposes, most Trade Stations and Shipyards carry a supply of weapon ammunition for Zirax Patrols. For the right price, you can re-arm any Imperial Turret using Station Services.\n\n[c][fb00ff][u][b]Disruptor Cannons:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nDuring the War of Silence, the Zirax fought to defend the galaxy from the attack of The Legacy that with their advanced, organic and adaptive technology quickly overwhelmed the Zirax Warfleets.\nTwo centuries later, the dormant ship-type creatures of The Legacy still dwell out in the cold dark, with their weapons still charged in low power.\n\nThese weapons cannot be retrieved from the Legacy without giving them a purchase within the systems of your own ship. However, many ship-type Legacy had internal factories that manufactured replacement components and weapons. It may be possible to find a functional weapon within their internal systems and repurpose it.\nThe synthetic-organic hybrid cells used to power these weapons can be ripped from the hearts of the unusable Disruptors and experimental Shockwave Emitters now being integrated into Zirax warships; Shockwave Emitters based on Disruptor technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Female Telluropods are considerably larger than their male counterparts and stay near the land to prevent overfishing male-populated areas.\nFemale Telluropods do not lay eggs, rather they grow from their backs from an early age; but do not mature until a successful mating.\n\n[b][c][ffffff]Distribution[-][/c][/b]: Telluropods are primarily found in swamplands and shallow water near fens and mudflats. Although found at the water line, they can also be found on land and are particulary hazardous for people navigating the swamplands without transportation due to the unexpected speeds that these creatures move at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_WCO4Sue,[b][c][ffffff]Package Information:[-][/c][/b]\nThis data package was queued up by [c][ffee00]I.D.A[-][/c] when you crafted a Detector or 15mm Gatling Round.\nThese files have been added to your Empyriopedia to explain how to use secondary firing modes on weapons and detectors and what they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_O0JW0am,"[b][c][00ffee][u]Secondary Firing Modes:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nSome weapons possess a secondary firing mode designed to be used as an alternative or in conjunction with their standard firing method. These are available for both handheld weapons as well as fixed and turret weapons.\nSecondary Firing Modes are available either through a [c][ffffff]Radial Menu[-][/c] or by using your [b][c][ffffff]Right-Mouse Button[-][/c][/b] (RMB). These do not consume different ammunition, but in the case of some unique weapons will have a lengthy delay (e.g. Elite Assault Rifle).\n\n[b][c][00ffee][u]Handheld Weapons:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nFew handheld weapons have a secondary firing mode; restricted mainly to the Heavy Weapons such as the Miniguns and Plasma Cannons.\n\n[b][c][ff0000]Miniguns:[-][/c][/b] By holding LMB and RMB together you can disengage the safeties on the weapon designed to keep the weapon controllable.\nThis doubles the RPM of the minigun's barrels; Increasing the rate of fire, damage and ammo consumption. You will suffer a significant increase in recoil and a reduction in accuracy however, so it's best used against in close quarters against multiple enemies or drones.\n\n[b][c][ff0000]Plasma Cannons:[-][/c][/b] The RMB will open a Radial Menu that allows you to adjust the output of the Plasma Cannon turning a ball of plasma into a Particle Beam.\nParticle Beams move at extremely high speeds and will pierce a hole straight through enemy units and small vessels. They do not explode like normal plasma shots, instead dealing massive damage to a single target; allowing them to destroy any Sentry Guns, Drones or Heavy Mechs.\n\n[b][c][ff0000]Elite Assault Rifle:[-][/c][/b] The Elite Assault Rifle is a customized variant of the Advanced Assault Rifle. Including improvements to the barrel and firing system for a slight improvement to the weapon's damage over the Advanced Assault Rifle; the Elite Assault Rifle sacrifices the use of a scope for an Underslung Grenade Launcher.\nBy pressing RMB, the weapon will fire an anti-personnel Frag Grenade in a ballistic arc up to 20 meters. Effective for clearing away hordes of Abominations and Infesters.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Scanning Equipment:[-][/c][/u][/b]\nDetectors allow you to find both ore deposits beneath the ground and enemies in your vicinity. With the secondary firing mode of the detector, you can keep enemies tagged on your HUD for 5 minutes so you can concentrate on the enemy instead of worrying about re-pinging your radar to find them.\n\n[b][c][2eafff]Detector (HV, SV, CV):[-][/c][/b] The standard Detector has two modes of Detection. The First fires a sonar-like pulse that detects all thermal, radiological and metallic activity up to it's maximum range and displays the results to the Pilot's HUD for 60 seconds.\nThe Second mode (RMB) fires a short-ranged pulse that will identify and tag all targets for 300 seconds. Allowing you to keep faster targets displayed on your HUD in combat without needing to change weapons in the heat of battle to reacquire the target after it has left your field of view.\n[b][c][2eafff][-][/c][/b]\n[b][c][2eafff]Long-Range Radar (SV, CV):[-][/c][/b] A high-powered upgrade of the standard detectors that will identify thermal and energy signatures at extremely long distances for a 5 second duration using LMB.\nUsing RMB will fire a secondary pulse that functions at the same distance as the standard detector but keep all identified targets displayed for 120 seconds, as opposed to the 60 seconds.\n\n[b][u][c][00ffee]Fixed Weapons:[-][/c][/u][/b]\n[b][c][ff0000]Multiple Rocket Launcher (CV):[-][/c][/b] Rather than an alternative firing mode; the Heavy Rocket Launcher for Capital Vessels engages safeties to allow the use of the primary weapon inside a planet's atmosphere at a reduced range and rate of fire.\nUnder normal circumstances, the firing of a space-designed weapon in atmosphere causes the weapon to detonate as it encounters the resistance and pressure of an atmosphere.\n\n[b][c][00ffee][u]Turrets:[/u][-][/c][/b]\nUnlike the fixed weapons, Turret's secondary modes are available ONLY while being manned by a person. They do not retain any mode settings, and therefore require that the pilot relinquish control of the ship or that the ship has additional players on board to manually operate the weapons.\n\n[b][c][ffae00]Cannon Turrets:[-][/c][/b]\nWith the Radial Menu (RMB) while manned, you can switch the Armor-Piercing Ammunition for Incendiary Rounds. These explosive rounds fire slower, but deal higher damage to drones and entities and set them on fire in the process.\n\n[b][c][ffae00]Artillery Turrets (CV, BA):[-][/c][/b]\nThe most unique of any Turret's firing mode, The Artillery Turret while manually operated can launch a 375mm EMP Shell instead of a standard artillery shell.\nThese unique weapons are shorter ranged, follow a ballistic trajectory, are comparatively slow-moving and deal no damage to any structure. However, on impact with a ship's shield the damage it deals to the shield is catastrophic. Either disabling the shield entirely or reducing the shield's strength by half.\nHeavy Artillery Turrets can fire EMP shells at twice the speed of the Standard Artillery Turrets.\nHV Heavy Artillery Turret can fire EMP shells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_C0S000q,"[u][c][00ffff][b]Weapon Effects[/b][-][/c][/u]\n\n[c][ffffff]Not all handheld weapons are created equal. Some weapons are better at some things than others, even though it may not seem like it. Others can be either too heavy or have too much recoil to be fired over a long duration, requiring restraint. There's no use in overusing a heavy weapon and being too exhausted to raise it when you need it.\nUse the information contained within this data package to help you decide on which kind of weapon you need for each type of enemy.[-][/c]\n\nThe creatures and people you'll encounter in the galaxy are a wide assortment from the soft dinosaurid wildlife of the plains, to the armored spiders and scorpions of the desert dunes.\nSmall caliber, hollow-point weapons like [b][c][dd0000]pistols[-][/c][/b] and [b][c][dd0000]submachine guns[-][/c][/b] are best suited for soft targets like wildlife and lightly armored humanoids.\nThose smaller caliber bullets will unfortunately do very little against the armor of mechanoids, androids and sentry robots.\n\nPacking more stopping power, the [b][c][0088ff]Assault[-][/c][/b] and [b][c][0088ff]Pulse Rifle[-][/c][/b] class of weapons favored by the UCH are predominantly used to put down lightly armored humanoids and have proven effective against the armored carapace of scorpions and overseers; though the ammunition of choice lacks stopping power against mechanical enemies, they're still very effective.\n\n[b][c][00ffff]Sniper Rifles[-][/c][/b] and other [b][c][00ffff]Anti-Material Rifles[-][/c][/b] used by the UCH prove effective where the Pistols and Rifles fall short, penetrating Mechanoid armor and even putting a serious dent in a Heavy Mechanoid's armor plating.\nBut that same penetration works against it against the larger, softer wildlife. Penetrating through-and-through, with less internal damage.\n\n[b][c][ffff00]Laser Weapons[-][/c][/b] are a recent addition to the UCH's line-up of weapons, with their effectiveness shared by [b][c][ffff00]Plasma weaponry[-][/c][/b].\nLaser weapons superheat their target, dealing massive thermal damage in an instant. Painful and damaging to a humanoid target, this has proven more effective and portable in dealing with mechanical enemies and light drones, melting their armor and components with a higher efficiency than expected.\nUnfortunately, the recent addition of a reflective coating on heavier drones and interceptors has reduced that effectiveness against those targets.\n\n[b][c][ffbb00]Shotguns[-][/c][/b] lack range and accuracy, but in the close confines of corridors and rooms these weapons make a serious mess of the lightly armored and soft targets that don't have much or any protection against a face full of buckshot.\nHowever, for those such as Heavy Mechanoids that [i]do[/i] have protection against buckshot, the shotgun barely makes a dent.\n\nAlthough not common on your average battlefield, [b][c][ffbb00]Miniguns[-][/c][/b] have proven to be more effective than previously thought once they were made small and light enough to be wielded by a soldier. Possessing an all-round effectiveness against armored targets, the Minigun is a sight to behold.\nUnfortunately, it's still heavy and possesses immense recoil, steadily draining the stamina of its wielder until it's too heavy to be fired.\n\n[b][c][ffff00]Flamethrowers[-][/c][/b], like miniguns are heavy weapons not suited for sustained firing. They do make up for it with a spectacular jet of burning fuel that will cook any form of wildlife, especially those nasty overseers and big bugs.\nUnfortunately, it's less effective against an armored humanoid and ineffective against any sort of mechanoid.\n\nFinally, we have rockets and missiles. Fast, destructive projectile weapons that will devastate whatever they hit. Most effective against drones, mechanoids and other heavily armored targets. They punch a hole inside and then detonate, leaving a smoking, burned-out husk to fall to the ground harmlessly.\n\n[c][00ff00][u][b]Outlying Weapons:[/b][/u][-][/c]\nAlthough the majority of weapons fit into the above classifications, there are some that prove to be more effective than their peers. Heavy Pistols, Elite Combat Pistols and Heavy Assault Rifles for example, all possess superior penetrating power, making them equally effective against armored humanoids as mechanoids.\nOther weapons may also possess advantages over types of enemies that isn't shared by its peers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some may have you collect an item or visit a specific planet type and you may have to warp to other star systems to complete it. Some missions use a combination of some or all of the PDA, tokens, and dialog.[-][/c]\n[c][ffffff]Most mission objectives can be obtained in multiple places in case you lose the item or otherwise can no longer complete the mission from a particular POI. Those that use unique POIs can either be repeated in the POI or can have the objectives manually marked as complete.[-][/c]\n\n\n[c][00ffff]I completed a mission and nothing happened. What now?[-][/c]\n[c][ffffff]Many of the custom missions and story is still a work in progress. Alpha 12 completely changed how missions and storytelling can be done so it required a rewrite of the PDA. If you find any unique items, hold on to them because they might have a purpose. More is planned to be added later on.[-][/c]\n\n\n[c][00ffff]I lost an important mission item. What do I do?[-][/c]\n[c][ffffff]Most of the important mission items can be obtained again, either from the same source you first found it at, or from another version of the POI somewhere else in the galaxy. For those that can only be obtained once, you can manually mark the mission objective as ""complete"".[-][/c][c][ffffff][-][/c]\n[c][ffffff]If you are well and truly stuck, leave a comment on the Workshop and I can help you out.[-][/c]\n[c][ffffff][-][/c]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead you can warp to each of its moons.\n\n[c][00ff00]Moon[-][/c]: A rocky body you can typically land on that orbits a planet or gas giant.\n[c][00ff00]Orbit[-][/c]: The area of space around a planet.\n[c][00ff00]Sector POI[-][/c]: Areas of space that lack a planet in the solar system, such as asteroid fields or standalone Trade Stations[c][00ff00].[-][/c]\n\n[c][00ff00]Playfield[-][/c]: An area of the game world. A planet is its own playfield, as is a moon and a space orbit. Going from planet to orbit means you enter a new playfield.\n[c][00ff00]Sector[-][/c]: Any location on the solar system map that you can warp to. A sector encompasses a planet, its orbit, and any of its moons. A standalone asteroid field can also be a sector.\n\n[c][00ff00]Solar System[-][/c]: An object on the galaxy map containing a star with various planets and sector POIs.

This is just general guidance.\n\nFirst, make sure your immediate surroundings are safe then read over any [c][00ff00]starting mission text[-][/c] (if there is any) and the information in the [c][00ff00]planet description[-][/c]. You can usually get a good idea of what you need to do based on those two things.\n\nNext you will need to find some Iron Ore if you didn't start with a [c][00ff00]Portable Constructor[-][/c]. On some planets this can be a challenge and you will have to travel far before you find your first iron. Once you've built a [c][00ff00]Portable Constructor[-][/c] you can use it to convert [c][00ff00]Crushed Stone[-][/c] into basic ores.\nFood can be obtained from wild [c][00ff00]plants [-][/c]and [c][00ff00]animals[-][/c], or from your starting missions.\nIf you are on a planet without oxygen, you will also need to set up a [c][00ff00]O2 Condenser[-][/c] to obtain oxygen.\n\nSome planets can have [c][ff0000]dangerous wildlife[-][/c], [c][ff0000]soldiers[-][/c], or [c][ff0000]drones [-][/c]hunting you, or[c][ff0000] extreme environments[-][/c] with radiation, temperature, or weather hazards. Check the planet description for any warnings.\nYou will need to think of creative solutions to dealing with the obstacles that you face. Some general hints:\n\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Some wildlife will run away when damaged. Use this to keep them away from you.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Pay attention to tooltips on wild plants. Some can cure ailments, but may cause food poisoning in the process.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Headshots deal more damage, especially against humanoids.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]If you have a jetpack, hiding on top of a rock can give you temporary safety from predators.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Drones can be intimidating enemies, but shooting them can disorient them and aiming for the red dot deals bonus damage. Pistols, assault rifles, and especially sniper rifles are more effective against drones than your shotgun or survival tool.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]You can use the player drone to mine, scout, or retrieve a lost backpack.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]The Survival Tool can harvest surface rocks, mine, damage enemies, and salvage blocks or devices, but it does these things poorly.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Promethium can sometimes be difficult to find but you can substitute bio fuel to power your ships.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Solar power is not effective on all starting planets.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Using the Fresh Start option will spawn you back on your original starting planet, but will not remove any of your reputation, levels, structures, or bank account balance. This can be used as a last resort if you die and cannot respawn in a safe location.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]Consider setting up some early game blueprints in creative mode tailored to your starting planet. Note that some starting planets forbid use of the blueprint factory.\n[c][ffff00]-[-][/c]You will usually only find basic resources on your starting planet, enough to build a Small Vessel.

eden_pda_m00SW,"Most starting planets only contain the basic resources needed for a starter Small Vessel.

The Small Vessel also needs thrusters in all 6 directions to be space worthy. You can build such a ship with resources found on your starting planet.\n\nNext you will need [c][00ff00]Cobalt[-][/c] either from Cobalt Asteroids found in orbit of your starting planet, or from Cobalt Deposits on the nearby moon. Cobalt will allow you to construct a [c][00ff00]Short Range Warp Drive[-][/c] and a [c][00ff00]Pentaxid Tank[-][/c] for your Small Vessel.\nThis will allow you to warp to the other locations in your starting solar system.\n\nIt is highly recommended, but not required, to complete the [c][00ff00]Solo [-][/c]mission [c][00ffff]Make Contact with Terran Forces[-][/c] at this time.

A good rule of thumb is you need 10m/s down thrust for each 1G of gravity on a planet with no atmosphere. Check your ship's thrust values in the statistics page of the control panel while in orbit and compare it to the planet's listed gravity. Atmospheric density can help provide extra lift to counteract gravity while your ship is in motion.\n-[c][ffff00]Temperature and radiation[-][/c].

Check the planet description for any hints and approach unfamiliar enemies with caution.\n-[c][ffff00]Low visibility[-][/c].
